Logos-NG: hopefully cleaner, more modular and easier to maintain.

Building is as simple as 'mvn clean install'

An OSGi testing environment can be provisioned using PAX Runner:

    mvn clean install pax:run

By default, Apache Felix is used as the underlying OSGi platform, but that can 
be easily changed. As an example, to use Eclipse Equinox:

    mvn clean install pax:run -Dplatform=equinox
	
Some logs on the console windows are eliminated by adjusting the logger level in
the file 'logging.properties'. Adjust the level to match your need.

'logging.properties' is passed to PAX-runner-provisioned testing environment by the 
file 'jvm-args'. Change the path of 'logging/properties' in 'jvm-args'

The build runs integration tests using PAX Exam. Tests may fail unless you have
a first Maven build as:
    
    mvn install -DskipTests=true
